                    Campgrounds within the parks are laid out in loops with water spigots located every few campsites, and centrally located restrooms, most with hot and cold running water and coin operated showers.

                    Each site has a fire ring or fireplace with grill for cooking and a picnic table.

                    Every park and campground has its own unique personality and offerings, each one is a little different. Some of the amenities you will find in the parks are playgrounds and play fields, camper's beaches, trails, horseshoe pits, volleyball courts, nature centers, day use areas with swimming beaches, picnic pavilions, boat rentals, hidden picnic areas and wide expanses of lawn.

            <h2>Fishing</h2>

		<p>		
                    The cold, clear water of Vermontâ€™s lakes and streams provide excellent fishing opportunities throughout the state in a magnificent natural setting. Mountain streams are prime spots for brook, brown and rainbow trout. Our lakes and ponds are known for bass, walleye, pike and other species.
                </p>
		<p>
                    Vermont State Parks are a gateway to these waterways and offer great fishing for a day on the lake, or a week-long base camp. Lake Carmi, Bomoseen, Lake St. Catherine, for instance, are some favorite fishing destinations. Seyon Lodge State Park, located on Noyes Pond in the Groton Forest is renowned as Vermont's sole public fly-fishing-only pond in Vermont.
		</p>
		<p>
                    Most parks located on the water provide canoe, kayak and row boat rentals and many sell fishing licenses.
                    The Vermont State Parks are proud to offer free loaner fishing gear, including rods & reels, lures, and waterbody info packets through the REELFUN program!
